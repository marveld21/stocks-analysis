# stocks-analysis

# Overview of Project
### Our customer Steve is doing finacial research for his parents on a green energy company DAQO. Steve wants to study both DAQO and some comparible stock tickers to encourage his parents to diversify.

### The ask from Steve is to create a VBA macro that he can use to compare stock data. Steve would also like to see the speed at which the code runs so that he can measure code performance on different datasets.

# Results
## Tables
### The tables below show the reults of our macro for each year being studied.

## Code Refactoring
### The first code when run with the 2018 and 2017 data completed in ... and ... respectively. Refactoring the code using arrays to assist in storage increased effiency and resulted in the code being run % faster.

# Summary of Code Refactoring
### Refactoring code increases code run effiencency and makes code easier to read but it can make it more difficult to write intially. A good strategy is to get a piece of code working, then return to the code to refactor.

### Our original script worked correctly and did not take very long to run. Our refactored script took much longer to write but runs % faster. With such a small dataset it probably was unessasry but as the data scales up the refactored code will increase in value.
